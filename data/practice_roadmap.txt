Learning GraphRAG benefits from hands-on, incremental practice. Begin by implementing a basic retrieval augmented generation pipeline with plain vector search. Next, introduce entity extraction to build a knowledge graph. Even a simple rule-based extractor is enough to demonstrate the concept. Use a graph library such as NetworkX to store entities, relationships, and chunk membership edges.

After the graph is in place, experiment with graph traversals for retrieval. Try breadth-first expansion from entities mentioned in a query. Compare the retrieved contexts against vector search alone to feel how the graph changes the evidence set. Finally, focus on evaluation. Measure whether answers become more accurate, diverse, or explainable. Iterate by swapping in stronger NLP components when you want higher fidelity.
