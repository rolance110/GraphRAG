Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation, often shortened to GraphRAG, blends knowledge graphs with large language models. The knowledge graph adds structure by connecting entities and their relationships. When a user asks a question, the system reasons over the graph to collect relevant context before generating a natural language answer. Microsoft popularised the approach in a 2024 paper that described using GraphRAG to analyse large document collections. Their implementation highlights how graph traversals can surface multi-hop relationships that pure vector search tends to miss.

The workflow typically starts with document ingestion. Raw text is chunked into passages. Each passage is analysed to extract entities such as people, organizations, and key phrases. Relations between entities are inferred by their co-occurrence or with a specialised information extraction model. The resulting graph stores both the entities and the chunks that mention them. During retrieval, the system looks for graph nodes connected to the user question and expands outwards to gather supporting evidence.
